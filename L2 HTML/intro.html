        <p style="text-align: justify;">Hey there, my loved ones call me as <b>Saad</b>. But I think it would be appropriate for
            you to call me so. I am currently continuing my studies in <i>grade 12</i> on <mark>Science</mark>. The destination 
        Where I gain knowledge is named <em>Saint Joseph Higher Secondary School</em>. I like spend more time with my friends 
    playing football or cricket. However, it doesn't imply that I hate that company of my family or relatives.     </p>
